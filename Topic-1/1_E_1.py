#Install Python and run a "Hello, World!" script. 

print("Hello, World!") 


#What You’ve Learned:
"""You installed Python: Now your computer understands Python code.
You wrote a script: Simple code that tells Python what to do.
You ran it: Python executed your code and displayed the output.
By running this, you’ve completed the basic process of writing and executing Python scripts!
The rest of the learning comes by experimenting with other commands and expanding beyond just printing messages."""
